# Tic-Tac-Toe

A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This game allows two players to take turns placing their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid, aiming to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal to win.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode**: Play against another person locally on the same device.
- **Interactive UI**: The game grid responds to player input, showing the current player's mark.
- **Win Detection**: The game detects when a player has won or if the game ends in a draw.
- **Reset Functionality**: Restart the game at any time to play again.

## File Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the Tic-Tac-Toe game board and layout.
- **style.css**: The CSS file that styles the game board and other elements.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that handles game logic, player turns, and win detection.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The game starts automatically.
2. **Take Turns**: Click on any empty cell in the 3x3 grid to place your mark (X or O). Players take turns.
3. **Win the Game**: Align three of your marks in a row, column, or diagonal to win.
4. **Draw**: If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
5. **Reset the Game**: Click the "Reset" button to clear the board and start a new game.

## Installation

To play the game, simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. No additional installation is required.

## Future Enhancements

- **AI Player**: Implement an AI to allow a single-player mode against the computer.
- **Score Tracking**: Add functionality to keep track of player scores across multiple rounds.
- **Animations**: Enhance the game with animations for a better user experience.
